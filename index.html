<h2>About Me</h2>
<span style="font-size: 0.7em; margin: 0"> 
Hi, I'm Hao Qin, a final-year PhD student at The University of Arizona in the 
program of <a href="https://statistics.arizona.edu/">GIDP-STATS</a>. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. <a href="https://zcc1307.github.io/">Chicheng Zhang</a>. 
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Shandong 
University and Master's degree in Data Science from The University of 
Wisconsin-Madison.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<span style="font-size: 0.7em; margin: 0"> 
My research interests are in the field of machine learning, especially in the area of reinforcement learning. I have a particular interest in identifying the crucial factors that quantify the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning, which is a fundamental problem in the field. A clear understanding of this trade-off will pave the way for designing more efficient algorithms in various applications, such as recommendation systems, robotics, and autonomous driving.

Currently, I am working on the following directions:
<ul>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
  <li>Inverse Reinforcement Learning</li>
  <li>Wireless Communications</li>
</ul>
